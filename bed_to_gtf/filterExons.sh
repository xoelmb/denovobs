# Filter-out any feature != "exon" of all GTF files in a folder, saving them as .EXONS.gtf

# So after coming back to this some time after I think I've found a relatively simple way of doing this. First use bedtools merge with -o count to merge overlapping elements and add a fourth column which shows how many original elements contributed to the new elements. Then use a command prompt to remove any rows that have a number greater than 1 in the fourth column, thus removing anything that originally overlapped and was merged. For example with a bed file (the same could be done with gtf):
# 
# bedtools merge -i file.bed -c 1 -o count | awk ' { if($4==1) print $0} ' > newfile.bed
